<h1 align="center">Selsey Book Club Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://debarati-datta.github.io/Selsey-Book-Club/)

This is the website for a neighbourhood book lovers club. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for members and non-members.

## Let's Talk Books

### The book club idea stems from the overall need for people to connect with other people. An informal chat with some neighbours down the road pointed towards the need of a common activity that can help people come together and chat. Book reading emerged as something everyone does to some degree so as I decided to take the idea forward.

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

- ### User 1 : I want to understand the purpose of the webpage

 1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. 
 2. The main points are made immediately with the 'About Us' and 'features' sections on the home page.
 
 
- ### User 2 : I want to navigate with ease

1. The navigation is simple and the home button brings you back from every page.
2. The facebook button at the bottom of each page takes you directly to the Selsey Book Club facebook page.

- ### User 3 : I want to know what other users of the club think about it

1. The home page has member quotes that expresses clearly that they value the club.
2. The gender mix of users is also expressed in the quotes section which leaves a positive impression on a new user.

- ### User 2 : Discuss Books with others
- ### User 3 : Know about different geners of books available
- ### User 4 : Start a book club in my own area

## Features

- ### The club helps form sub-groups of readers who enjoy the same/similar books and connects them via the [Facebook](facebook.com) app.


- ### The "popular titles" provides a list of books that already have sub-groups discussing them. This allows members to get involved with with a specific interest group and mingle more meaningfully.


- ### The Club facilitates various outdoor events for the book club members. These are organised by members themselves within their specific groups.

## New Features to be implemented in future

- A donate page that links to a larger charity that supplies books to the underpriviledged in certain countries.
